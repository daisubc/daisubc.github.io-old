    <p>This paper develops a switching strategy for adaptive state estimation in systems represented by nonlinear, stochastic, discrete- time state space models (SSMs). The developed strategy is motivated by the fact that there is no single Bayesian estimator that is guaranteed to perform optimally for a given nonlinear system and under all operating conditions. The proposed strategy constructs a bank of plausible Bayesian estimators for adaptive state estimation, and then switches between them based on their performance. The performance of a Bayesian estimator is assessed using a performance metric derived from the posterior Cramer- Rao lower bound (PCRLB). It is shown that the switching strategy is stable, and yields estimates that are at least as good as any individual estimator in the bank. The efficacy of the switching strategy is illustrated on a practical simulation example.</p>

    <p>In process and manufacturing industries, alarm systems play a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient operations. The objective of a standard industrial alarm system is to detect undesirable deviations in process variables as soon as they occur. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems often need to be alerted by an industrial alarm system; however, poorly designed alarms often lead to alarm flooding and other undesirable events. In this paper, we consider the problem of industrial alarm design for processes represented by stochastic nonlinear time-series models. The alarm design for such complex processes faces three important challenges: 1) industrial processes exhibit highly nonlinear behavior; 2) state variables are not precisely known (modeling error); and 3) process signals are not necessarily Gaussian, stationary or uncorrelated. In this paper, a procedure for designing a delay timer alarm configuration is proposed for the process states. The proposed design is based on minimization of the rate of false and missed alarm rates – two common performance measures for alarm systems. To ensure the alarm design is robust to any non-stationary process behavior, an expected-case and a worst-case alarm designs are proposed. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed alarm design is illustrated on a non-stationary chemical reactor problem.</p>

    <p>This paper addresses both the design of an optimal variable setpoint and a setpoint-tracking control loop for the dissolved oxygen concentration in a biological wastewater treatment process. Although exact knowledge of influent changes during rain/storm events is unrealistic, we take advantage of the fact that during dry weather conditions the influent changes are periodic and thus predictable. Specifically, a nonlinear optimization procedure utilizes dry weather data to decide on a nominal fixed setpoint, or a weighting gain, or both; during weather events an algorithm uses the optimization solution(s) together with the ammonium predictions to adjust the setpoint dynamically (responding appropriately to significant changes in the influent). A constrained nonlinear neural-network model predictive control tracks the setpoint. Simulations with the BSM1 compare several variations of the proposed methods to a fixed-setpoint PI control, demonstrating improvement in effluent quality or reduction in energy use, or both.</p>

    <p>This paper proposes a locality preserving discriminative canonical variate analysis (LP-DCVA) scheme for fault diagnosis. The LP-DCVA method provides a set of optimal projection vectors that simultaneously maximizes the within-class mutual canonical correlations, minimizes the between-class mutual canonical correlations, and preserves the local structures present in the data. This method inherits the strength of canonical variate analysis (CVA) in handling high-dimensional data with serial correlations and the advantages of Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) in pattern classification. Moreover, the incorporation of locality preserving projection (LPP) in this method makes it suitable for dealing with nonlinearities in the form of local manifolds in the data. The solution to the proposed approach is formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for fault classification is verified by the Tennessee Eastman process. Simulation results show that the LP-DCVA method outperforms the FDA, dynamic FDA (DFDA), CVA-FDA, and localized DFDA (L-DFDA) approaches in fault diagnosis.</p>

    <p>Traditional techniques employed by process control engineers require a significant update in order to handle the increasing complexity of modern processes. Conveniently, advances in statistical machine learning and distributed computation have led to an abundance of new techniques that are potentially suitable for advanced analysis of chemical processes. In this tutorial we briefly introduce popular data analytics techniques and discuss their potential for application in the chemical process industries. Specifically, this tutorial provides control engineers with a practical understanding of data analytics techniques, some of which may be unconventional in chemical process applications. Each of the presented techniques can potentially extract valuable knowledge from raw data, which can then be utilized to make smarter process control decisions.</p>

To determine an optimal control policy for the constrained linear system affected by random disturbances and measurements corrupted by random noise, the authors have minimized the uncertain objective function, subject to uncertain state &amp; output constraints and deterministic input constraints using the quantile based scenario analysis approach. In this work, ensemble Kalman filter is being employed, to generate a recursive estimate of states of the constrained stochastic linear system. The number of scenarios is considered to be equivalent to that of number of sample points used in the ensemble Kalman filter. Each scenario is viewed as one realization of the process noise, measurement noise over the prediction horizon as well as the ith sample point of the state estimate at the beginning of the prediction horizon generated by the ensemble Kalman filter. Simulation studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed control scheme on the simulated model of the constrained single- input and single-output linear stochastic system.</p>

    <p>The bale collection problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations of agricultural crops. Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation systems in autonomous agricultural vehicles and machines are able to provide accurate data for reliable bale collection planning. This paper presents a constrained k-means algorithm and nearest neighbour approach to the BCP, which minimizes travel time and hence fuel consumption. The constraints imposed on the k-means procedure is not the usual condition that certain groups of objects must be clustered together, but rather that the cluster centers must lie on valid locations, which may be specified as functions or sets of points. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a simulated study area similar to those found in real situations.</p>

    <p>We propose a model-plant mismatch (MPM) detection strategy based on a novel closed-loop identification approach and one-class support vector machine (SVM) learning technique. With this scheme we can monitor MPM and noise model change separately, thus discriminating the MPM from noise model change. Another advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to routine operating data that may lack any external excitations. Theoretical derivations on the closed-loop identification method are provided in this paper, showing that it can furnish a consistent parameter estimate for the process model even in the case where a priori knowledge about the true noise model structure is not available. We build an SVM model based on process and noise model estimates from training data to predict the occurrence of MPM in the testing data. An example on paper machine control is provided to verify the proposed MPM detection framework.</p>

    <p>We propose to use noncausal transfer functions to model the spatial behavior of cross-directional (CD) processes so as to circumvent the high-dimensionality of a causal transfer function. This noncausal representation is shown to have a causal-equivalent form. We prove that the covariance of maximum likelihood estimate of the causal-equivalent model asymptotically converges to that of the noncausal model. This result is then used to design optimal inputs for the original noncausal model of the CD process. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the advantage of using optimally designed excitation signal for CD closed-loop identification over white noise excitation or the current industrial practice of spatial bump excitation.</p>

    <p>In this work, we have extended the current success of deep learning and reinforcement learning to process control problems. We have shown that if reward hypothesis functions are formulated properly, they can be used for industrial process control. The controller setup follows the typical reinforcement learning setup, whereby an agent (controller) interacts with an environment (process) through control actions and receives a reward in discrete time steps. Deep neural networks serve as function approximators and are used to learn the control policies. Once trained, the learned network acquires a policy that maps system output to control actions. Though the policies are not explicitly specified, the deep neural networks were able to learn policies that are different from the traditional controllers. We evaluated our approach on Single Input Single Output Systems (SISO), Multi-Input Multi-Out.</p>

In this paper, the spatial and temporal performance limitations in the cross- directional (CD) control of paper machines are analyzed. The idea of minimum variance benchmarking is extended to the CD process based on these performance limitations. Based on an industrial CD controller, a user-specified benchmark, which is more practical and less aggressive, is also proposed. In addition, several related performance indices are proposed for the CD process based on both the minimum variance benchmark and the user-specified benchmark. Illustrative examples from a paper machine simulator and industrial data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed performance indices.</p>

    <p>Supply chain optimization for biomass-based power plants is an important research area due to greater emphasis on renewable power energy sources. Biomass supply chain design and operational planning models are often formulated and studied using deterministic mathematical models. While these models are beneficial for making decisions, their applicability to real world problems may be limited because they do not capture all the complexities in the supply chain, including uncertainties in the parameters. This paper develops a statistically robust quantile-based approach for stochastic optimization under uncertainty, which builds upon scenario analysis. We apply and evaluate the performance of our approach to address the problem of analyzing competing biomass supply chains subject to stochastic demand and supply. The proposed approach was found to outperform alternative methods in terms of computational efficiency and ability to meet the stochastic problem requirements.</p>

    <p>The collection of sawmill residues is an important logistic activity for the pulp and paper industry, which uses the biomass as a source of energy. We study a vehicle routing problem for a network composed of a single depot and several sawmills. The sawmills serve as potential suppliers of biomass residues to the depot, which in turn processes and distributes the residues to the pulp and paper mills. This problem consists of identifying the best daily routing schedule for a fixed number of trucks. The objective is to maximize the ratio of energy returned on energy invested, while satisfying a minimum daily amount of dried biomass residues. There are several random components in the problem, including the availability and moisture content of the biomass residues. We use a combination of scenario analysis and heuristics to solve this stochastic vehicle routing problem. A performance comparison of the proposed method reveals an estimated daily energy savings of 6 GJ over the benchmark method.</p>

    <p>We have expanded a former compartmental model of blood glucose regulation for healthy and type II diabetic subjects. The former model was a detailed physiological model which considered the interactions of three substances, glucose, insulin and glucagon on regulating the blood sugar. The main drawback of the former model was its restriction on the route of glucose entrance to the body which was limited to the intravenous glucose injection. To handle the oral glucose intake, we have added a model of glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract to the former model to address the resultant variations of blood glucose concentrations following an oral glucose intake. Another model representing the incretins production in the gastrointestinal tract along with their hormonal effects on boosting pancreatic insulin production is also added to the former model. We have used two sets of clinical data obtained during oral glucose tolerance test and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion test from both type II diabetic and healthy subjects to estimate the model parameters and to validate the model results. The estimation of model parameters is accomplished through solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The results show acceptable precision of the estimated model parameters and demonstrate the capability of the model in accurate prediction of the body response during the clinical trials.</p>

    <p>Several methods have been proposed for evaluating a person’s insulin sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. However, none are easy or inexpernsive to implement since the plasma insulin concentration, a key variable for assessing the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), is required to be clinically measured at specific times. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a new ISI that can be easily and accurately obtained by patients themselves without costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient testing methods. This study proposes a simple self-administered testing method, simulated on a computerized model of type II diabetic patients, for estimating the ISI. The test involces a 75-g glucoase ingestion and two injections of 10 mU/kg insulin. Blood glucoe is measured one and two hours later. The test was evaluated by using a previously developed diabetic-patient dynamic model. Fifteen sets of OGTT data from diabetic patients published in the literature were used for the model development. A simulation of the proposed self-administered test indicates that the proposed ISI correlates well with the ISI called M-value obtained from the gold standard but elaborate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r=0.927, ;p=0.0045). The proposed ISI is considered to be easy to perform, time-saving, inexpensive, and accurate enough for clinical assessments.</p>

    <p>This paper develops a switching strategy for adaptive state estimation in systems represented by nonlinear, stochastic, discrete- time state space models (SSMs). The developed strategy is motivated by the fact that there is no single Bayesian estimator that is guaranteed to perform optimally for a given nonlinear system and under all operating conditions. The proposed strategy constructs a bank of plausible Bayesian estimators for adaptive state estimation, and then switches between them based on their performance. The performance of a Bayesian estimator is assessed using a performance metric derived from the posterior Cramer- Rao lower bound (PCRLB). It is shown that the switching strategy is stable, and yields estimates that are at least as good as any individual estimator in the bank. The efficacy of the switching strategy is illustrated on a practical simulation example.</p>

    <p>In process and manufacturing industries, alarm systems play a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient operations. The objective of a standard industrial alarm system is to detect undesirable deviations in process variables as soon as they occur. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems often need to be alerted by an industrial alarm system; however, poorly designed alarms often lead to alarm flooding and other undesirable events. In this paper, we consider the problem of industrial alarm design for processes represented by stochastic nonlinear time-series models. The alarm design for such complex processes faces three important challenges: 1) industrial processes exhibit highly nonlinear behavior; 2) state variables are not precisely known (modeling error); and 3) process signals are not necessarily Gaussian, stationary or uncorrelated. In this paper, a procedure for designing a delay timer alarm configuration is proposed for the process states. The proposed design is based on minimization of the rate of false and missed alarm rates – two common performance measures for alarm systems. To ensure the alarm design is robust to any non-stationary process behavior, an expected-case and a worst-case alarm designs are proposed. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed alarm design is illustrated on a non-stationary chemical reactor problem.</p>

    <p>This paper addresses both the design of an optimal variable setpoint and a setpoint-tracking control loop for the dissolved oxygen concentration in a biological wastewater treatment process. Although exact knowledge of influent changes during rain/storm events is unrealistic, we take advantage of the fact that during dry weather conditions the influent changes are periodic and thus predictable. Specifically, a nonlinear optimization procedure utilizes dry weather data to decide on a nominal fixed setpoint, or a weighting gain, or both; during weather events an algorithm uses the optimization solution(s) together with the ammonium predictions to adjust the setpoint dynamically (responding appropriately to significant changes in the influent). A constrained nonlinear neural-network model predictive control tracks the setpoint. Simulations with the BSM1 compare several variations of the proposed methods to a fixed-setpoint PI control, demonstrating improvement in effluent quality or reduction in energy use, or both.</p>

    <p>This paper proposes a locality preserving discriminative canonical variate analysis (LP-DCVA) scheme for fault diagnosis. The LP-DCVA method provides a set of optimal projection vectors that simultaneously maximizes the within-class mutual canonical correlations, minimizes the between-class mutual canonical correlations, and preserves the local structures present in the data. This method inherits the strength of canonical variate analysis (CVA) in handling high-dimensional data with serial correlations and the advantages of Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) in pattern classification. Moreover, the incorporation of locality preserving projection (LPP) in this method makes it suitable for dealing with nonlinearities in the form of local manifolds in the data. The solution to the proposed approach is formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for fault classification is verified by the Tennessee Eastman process. Simulation results show that the LP-DCVA method outperforms the FDA, dynamic FDA (DFDA), CVA-FDA, and localized DFDA (L-DFDA) approaches in fault diagnosis.</p>

    <p>The minimum variance controller has been extensively used as a benchmark in the performance assessment of both univariate and multivariate control loops when time delay is the fundamental performance limitation. In this paper, the spatial and temporal performance limitations in the cross- directional (CD) control of paper machines are analyzed. The idea of minimum variance benchmarking is extended to the CD process based on these performance limitations. Based on an industrial CD controller, a user-specified benchmark, which is more practical and less aggressive, is also proposed. In addition, several related performance indices are proposed for the CD process based on both the minimum variance benchmark and the user-specified benchmark. Illustrative examples from a paper machine simulator and industrial data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed performance indices.</p>

    <p>Supply chain optimization for biomass-based power plants is an important research area due to greater emphasis on renewable power energy sources. Biomass supply chain design and operational planning models are often formulated and studied using deterministic mathematical models. While these models are beneficial for making decisions, their applicability to real world problems may be limited because they do not capture all the complexities in the supply chain, including uncertainties in the parameters. This paper develops a statistically robust quantile-based approach for stochastic optimization under uncertainty, which builds upon scenario analysis. We apply and evaluate the performance of our approach to address the problem of analyzing competing biomass supply chains subject to stochastic demand and supply. The proposed approach was found to outperform alternative methods in terms of computational efficiency and ability to meet the stochastic problem requirements.</p>

    <p>The collection of sawmill residues is an important logistic activity for the pulp and paper industry, which uses the biomass as a source of energy. We study a vehicle routing problem for a network composed of a single depot and several sawmills. The sawmills serve as potential suppliers of biomass residues to the depot, which in turn processes and distributes the residues to the pulp and paper mills. This problem consists of identifying the best daily routing schedule for a fixed number of trucks. The objective is to maximize the ratio of energy returned on energy invested, while satisfying a minimum daily amount of dried biomass residues. There are several random components in the problem, including the availability and moisture content of the biomass residues. We use a combination of scenario analysis and heuristics to solve this stochastic vehicle routing problem. A performance comparison of the proposed method reveals an estimated daily energy savings of 6 GJ over the benchmark method.</p>

    <p>We have expanded a former compartmental model of blood glucose regulation for healthy and type II diabetic subjects. The former model was a detailed physiological model which considered the interactions of three substances, glucose, insulin and glucagon on regulating the blood sugar. The main drawback of the former model was its restriction on the route of glucose entrance to the body which was limited to the intravenous glucose injection. To handle the oral glucose intake, we have added a model of glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract to the former model to address the resultant variations of blood glucose concentrations following an oral glucose intake. Another model representing the incretins production in the gastrointestinal tract along with their hormonal effects on boosting pancreatic insulin production is also added to the former model. We have used two sets of clinical data obtained during oral glucose tolerance test and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion test from both type II diabetic and healthy subjects to estimate the model parameters and to validate the model results. The estimation of model parameters is accomplished through solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The results show acceptable precision of the estimated model parameters and demonstrate the capability of the model in accurate prediction of the body response during the clinical trials.</p>

    <p>Several methods have been proposed for evaluating a person’s insulin sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. However, none are easy or inexpernsive to implement since the plasma insulin concentration, a key variable for assessing the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), is required to be clinically measured at specific times. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a new ISI that can be easily and accurately obtained by patients themselves without costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient testing methods. This study proposes a simple self-administered testing method, simulated on a computerized model of type II diabetic patients, for estimating the ISI. The test involces a 75-g glucoase ingestion and two injections of 10 mU/kg insulin. Blood glucoe is measured one and two hours later. The test was evaluated by using a previously developed diabetic-patient dynamic model. Fifteen sets of OGTT data from diabetic patients published in the literature were used for the model development. A simulation of the proposed self-administered test indicates that the proposed ISI correlates well with the ISI called M-value obtained from the gold standard but elaborate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r=0.927, ;p=0.0045). The proposed ISI is considered to be easy to perform, time-saving, inexpensive, and accurate enough for clinical assessments.</p>

    <p>Traditional techniques employed by process control engineers require a significant update in order to handle the increasing complexity of modern processes. Conveniently, advances in statistical machine learning and distributed computation have led to an abundance of new techniques that are potentially suitable for advanced analysis of chemical processes. In this tutorial we briefly introduce popular data analytics techniques and discuss their potential for application in the chemical process industries. Specifically, this tutorial provides control engineers with a practical understanding of data analytics techniques, some of which may be unconventional in chemical process applications. Each of the presented techniques can potentially extract valuable knowledge from raw data, which can then be utilized to make smarter process control decisions.</p>

    <p>In this paper, the authors have proposed an ensemble Kalman filter based stochastic model predictive control algorithm to determine an optimal control policy at every sampling time instant for a constrained stochastic linear system. To determine an optimal control policy for the constrained linear system affected by random disturbances and measurements corrupted by random noise, the authors have minimized the uncertain objective function, subject to uncertain state &amp; output constraints and deterministic input constraints using the quantile based scenario analysis approach. In this work, ensemble Kalman filter is being employed, to generate a recursive estimate of states of the constrained stochastic linear system. The number of scenarios is considered to be equivalent to that of number of sample points used in the ensemble Kalman filter. Each scenario is viewed as one realization of the process noise, measurement noise over the prediction horizon as well as the ith sample point of the state estimate at the beginning of the prediction horizon generated by the ensemble Kalman filter. Simulation studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed control scheme on the simulated model of the constrained single- input and single-output linear stochastic system.</p>

    <p>The bale collection problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations of agricultural crops. Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation systems in autonomous agricultural vehicles and machines are able to provide accurate data for reliable bale collection planning. This paper presents a constrained k-means algorithm and nearest neighbour approach to the BCP, which minimizes travel time and hence fuel consumption. The constraints imposed on the k-means procedure is not the usual condition that certain groups of objects must be clustered together, but rather that the cluster centers must lie on valid locations, which may be specified as functions or sets of points. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a simulated study area similar to those found in real situations.</p>

    <p>We propose a model-plant mismatch (MPM) detection strategy based on a novel closed-loop identification approach and one-class support vector machine (SVM) learning technique. With this scheme we can monitor MPM and noise model change separately, thus discriminating the MPM from noise model change. Another advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to routine operating data that may lack any external excitations. Theoretical derivations on the closed-loop identification method are provided in this paper, showing that it can furnish a consistent parameter estimate for the process model even in the case where a priori knowledge about the true noise model structure is not available. We build an SVM model based on process and noise model estimates from training data to predict the occurrence of MPM in the testing data. An example on paper machine control is provided to verify the proposed MPM detection framework.</p>

    <p>We propose to use noncausal transfer functions to model the spatial behavior of cross-directional (CD) processes so as to circumvent the high-dimensionality of a causal transfer function. This noncausal representation is shown to have a causal-equivalent form. We prove that the covariance of maximum likelihood estimate of the causal-equivalent model asymptotically converges to that of the noncausal model. This result is then used to design optimal inputs for the original noncausal model of the CD process. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the advantage of using optimally designed excitation signal for CD closed-loop identification over white noise excitation or the current industrial practice of spatial bump excitation.</p>

    <p>In this work, we have extended the current success of deep learning and reinforcement learning to process control problems. We have shown that if reward hypothesis functions are formulated properly, they can be used for industrial process control. The controller setup follows the typical reinforcement learning setup, whereby an agent (controller) interacts with an environment (process) through control actions and receives a reward in discrete time steps. Deep neural networks serve as function approximators and are used to learn the control policies. Once trained, the learned network acquires a policy that maps system output to control actions. Though the policies are not explicitly specified, the deep neural networks were able to learn policies that are different from the traditional controllers. We evaluated our approach on Single Input Single Output Systems (SISO), Multi-Input Multi-Out.</p>
